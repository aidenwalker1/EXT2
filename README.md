EXT2 File System

Working EXT2 file system which can work with files, such as writing and reading, and directories, like mkdir. Uses a console interface, with command names the same as they are in linux.

To run:

Run mkdisk to create an empty disk which can be mounted to, which outputs a file called vdisk.

Compile files with compiler of your choice (cmake, etc)

Run main with either no arguments to run a disk named vdisk, or provide the file name as the first argument

Type 'quit' to exit program
